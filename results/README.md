# Results Directory

This directory contains all analysis results generated by running the main script.

## Generated Files

After running `uv run python src/main.py`, you will find:

### Text Results

- **main_effect_results_top10.txt**: Top 10 SNPs with highest main effect weights
- **main_effect_results_all.txt**: All SNPs with main effect weights (sorted by score, descending)
- **epistatic_interactions_top10.txt**: Top 10 epistatic interaction pairs (5 intra-chr + 5 inter-chr)
- **epistatic_interactions_all.txt**: All epistatic interaction pairs (sorted by score, descending)
- **training_history.txt**: Training history for all models (loss and metric values per epoch)

### Visualization Files

- **training_curves_intra_chr*.png**: Training curves for intra-chromosome models
- **training_curves_inter_*.png**: Training curves for inter-chromosome models
- **main_effect_manhattan_top10.png**: Manhattan plot of Top 10 main effects
- **main_effect_manhattan_all.png**: Manhattan plot of all main effects
- **epistatic_heatmap_top10.png**: Heatmap of Top 10 epistatic interactions
- **epistatic_heatmap_all.png**: Heatmap of all epistatic interactions

## File Format

- **Text files**: Tab-separated values (TSV) format, can be opened in Excel or any text editor
- **Image files**: PNG format, high resolution (300 DPI)

## Note

Results are sorted by score in descending order:
- Higher `Main_Effect_Weight` = more significant main effect
- Higher `Epistatic_Score` = more significant epistatic interaction
